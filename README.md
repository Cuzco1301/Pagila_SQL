## ðŸ“Š Caso de Estudio 1: Category Ranking by Total Rentals

### 1. The Business Question
**Objective:** To determine which movie category generates the highest number of rental events to prioritize inventory purchasing.
**Impact:** This result guides management in inventory optimization and purchasing strategy to maximize Return on Investment (ROI).

### 2. The Data Strategy (SQL)
A complex query using four JOINs was necessary to link the rental events with their categories:
* **Tables Joined:** `category` â†’ `film_category` â†’ `inventory` â†’ `rental`.
* **Aggregation:** The `COUNT(rental_id)` function was used to sum all unique rental events.

### 3. The Source Code (SQL Query)
```sql
SELECT
    c.name AS category_name,
    COUNT(r.rental_id) AS total_rentals
FROM
    category AS c
JOIN film_category AS fc USING (category_id)
JOIN inventory AS i USING (film_id)
JOIN rental AS r USING (inventory_id)
GROUP BY
    c.name
ORDER BY
    total_rentals DESC;
```
